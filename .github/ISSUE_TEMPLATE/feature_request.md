##### House rules

- If this issue has a `🚨 needs approval` label, don't start coding yet. Wait until a core member approves feature request by removing this label, then you can start coding.
  - For clarity: Non-core member issues automatically get the `🚨 needs approval` label.
  - Your feature ideas are invaluable to us! However, they undergo review to ensure alignment with the product's direction.
  - Follow Best Practices lined out in our [Contributor Docs](https://github.com/kumarayushkumar/curlme?tab=contributing-ov-file)
